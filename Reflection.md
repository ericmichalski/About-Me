I've only completed two co-op terms at the same company, Siemens, and both of them so far have been enjoyable and great learning experiences.
Compared to school, it's quite different and having that familiarity and experience before graduating will be exceptionally useful for me.
At the beginning of my first co-op, I honestly wasn't quite sure what to expect from it.
I was a little nervous, mostly though because I didn't know what the work may be like, or how much work I may get, but, it ended up being an enjoyable experience.
Although, it was unfortunate that we were required to switch to an online co-op during the middle of the term.
Through my co-op experiences, I was able to learn a lot, not just in technical skills, but also the average work environment and scheduling.
It helped me to more specifically decide what I wanted to pursue since I was able to gain experience in the computer science field.
The co-op program is very useful, and I'm glad that I had the opportunity to go through college with the program.
If I started over again, I don't think I would change anything in terms of the academic and career paths that I am pursuing.
Regarding my future goals with the co-op program, I hope to further expand my programming skills along with potentially doing a co-op in the game industry.
