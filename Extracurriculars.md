I currently am involved in the University of Cincinnati Band along with the UC Esport's club.
I was involved one year with UCs bowling team, however, I was not able to continue participating due to covid restrictions and co-op.
But, I enjoyed my time being a part of the team since it was a fun and casual experience.

Regarding the UC Band, I play the trumpet, and have gladly been a part of it ever since I have been at UC.
I have been a part of the marching, concert, and basketball bands for most of my time here, excluding the semesters when I was on co-op.
Through this, I have met plenty of people and have created lots of wonderful music with them.
I continue to strive to perform better by practicing consistently and enjoy every time I get the chance to play.

I have also been on the UC Esports team for Rainbow 6: Siege since January of 2020 and have enjoyed every part of it so far.
I am able to meet several more people from across the country, and I have developed a lot of various connections as well through it.
I have not been a part of a leadership position yet, however I do contribute a lot to the team and support each member.
