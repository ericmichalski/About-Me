Co-op at Siemens in Milford, OH, January - May 2020:  
1) Work
    - Prototyped and developed Key Manager website
    - Created Behavior-Driven Development tests for UI testing
    - Performed JS Unit tests
2) Through this co-op experience, I developed and improved a few techincal skills including Typescript/Javascript, HTML, Cucumber, and the BDD Framework.
These are important since they helped expand my knowledge of languages, allowing me to be more versatile.
3) I also improved client-server interconnection and my debugging skills. These are very important since they can be applied to almost any language and debugging is a necessary skill since bugs will be present.
