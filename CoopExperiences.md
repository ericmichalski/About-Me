Co-op at Siemens in Milford, OH, January - May 2020:  
1) Work
    - Prototyped and developed Key Manager website
        - The Key Manager secured and contained public and private cryptographic keys for various customers
        - This integrated Key Manager into the new Siemens web framework to allow more interconnectivity between Siemen products
    - Created Behavior-Driven Development tests for UI testing
        - Allowed Siemens to automatically run various tests on the UI for Key Manager much more efficiently
    - Performed JS Unit tests
        - Allowed Siemens to automatically run various tests on the JS code regarding the servers within Key Manager
2) Through this co-op experience, I developed and improved a few techincal skills including: Typescript/Javascript, HTML, Cucumber, and the BDD Framework. These are important since they helped expand my knowledge of languages, allowing me to be more versatile.
3) I also improved client-server interconnection and my debugging skills. These are very important since they can be applied to almost any language and debugging is a necessary skill since bugs will be present.

Co-op at Siemens, in Milford, OH, August - December 2020:  
1) Work
    - Developed SystemD Unit file for starting/stopping a Server Manager
        - Allowed customers to have a secondary, newer option for starting and stopping a server manager within Siemen products
    - Transferred BDD tests created in prior co-op term to Puppeteer UI testing framework
        - This adjustment made Siemens UI testing more unified and efficient for Key Manager
    - Performed several installation tests for Key Manager
        - Allowed Siemens to ensure the integrity of the files, servers, and installations of Key Manager
    - Updated Apache HTTP Client for Key Manager and TcSS applications
        - Ensured that HTTP Client stayed up to date for Key Manager and TcSS
    - Performed Dispatcher Client tests in a distributed environment
        - Tests were done in regards to a customer support
2) Through my second co-op experience, I developed and improved my skills in the Puppeteer framework, TypeScript, UI interaction, and my understanding of Linux systems and of several applications within Siemens. These are important since they expanded my knowledge and understanding of several things and even though some things are specific to Siemens, the applications they bring along with other skills I learned can be applied elsewhere.
3) I also developed and improved my presentation and communication skills, as I gave a final presentation (just like the first co-op) along with a few other presentations throughout the term. These skills are very important for a programmer since I need to communicate my projects well to both other programmers and people in other positions so that they can understand it well.
